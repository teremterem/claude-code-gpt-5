# OPTIONAL: Set the Anthropic API key if you still want to use Anthropic models
# (which you can do by unsetting some of the remaps below in this file, or by
# explicitly setting them to map back to the Anthropic models).
#ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=

# RECOMMENDED: You are better off relying on the remaps below, rather than
# setting the desired model in Claude Caude CLI via `claude --model gpt-5-...`
# (even though you could also do that).
#
# The reason being that there are some built-in agents in Claude Code that do
# not inherit the model that was chosen globaly for the CLI and instead are
# hardwired to always use specific models by Anthropic.
#
# (If you do not want to use these remaps but also want to avoid getting
# warnings, then, instead of commenting them out, simply set them to empty
# strings.)

# LITELLM master key used to authenticate requests to a LiteLLM proxy (when enabled).
# Set the same value on the LiteLLM server (e.g. via docker compose) and provide it here so Claude Code can call the proxy.
# Any non-empty string works; recommended to look like "sk-..." and keep it private. Leave unset to skip auth and rely on your proxy's own config.
# Tip: You can also run with an inline Anthropic key when needed:
#   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-... claude <args>
# Note: If you're already logged into Claude Code, log out first so the inline key takes effect.

# RECOMMENDED: Keep the setting below `true` (or unset, which is equivalent).
# Claude Code CLI cannot handle multiple tool calls in a single model response,
# which GPT-5 with medium/high reasoning effort may attempt.

# OPTIONAL: Langfuse configuration for logging all LiteLLM requests/responses.
